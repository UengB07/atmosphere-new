         <h1>ENERGY</h1>

         <article>

            <h2>BASICS</h2>

            <p>There are many types of energy. Energy can be usually put
               into two categories, potential and kinetic.
               Potential is usually approximated as "stored" energy, though
               not quite and kinetic energy is energy in motion,
               though not quite. <i>The general formula
                  for potential energy (PE) is:</i></p>

            <p><strong>PE = mgh</strong></p>

            <p>(where m is the mass of the object, g is the gravitational constant,
               and h is the height from ground level).
            </p>

            <p><i>while the general formula for kinetic energy (KE) is</i></p>

            <p><strong>KE = (1/2)mv<sup>2</sup></strong></p>

            <p>(where m is the mass and v is the velocity).</p>

            <p>Heat is usually an observation of kinetic energy,
               and in this subject, we see <em>radiant energy</em>
               as a form of kinetic energy of high importance.
            </p>

            <p>Energy may not "created" or "destroyed." It can be
               translated and transformed. </p>

            <h2>Temperature</h2>

            <p><strong>Temperature</strong> is a measure of the average
               speed of molecules in motion. We do not usually use m/s
               as our unit, we use an easier system based on Kelvin,
               Celsius or Farenheit. </p>

            <p>Throughout this doucment, we will refer to warm air
               as less dense as the molecules, on average are farther
               apart and colder air as more dense.
            </p>

            <p>Let us say you had two ponds, A and B. They both
               are the same temperature and contain the same internal energy.
            </p>

            <p>
               Pour A into B. Now B has more internal energy than A even though
               they are same temperature. B is now more massive. The average speed of the molecules are
               stil the same in both.
            </p>

            <p>
               You sip a cup of hot tea on a massive cool lake. The lake even though
               it is cooler has more internal energy but lower temperature and
               average speed of molecules. It is more massive.
            </p>

            <p>Heat - a process of energy transfer.</p>

         </article>

         <p>There are many scales of temperature:</p>

         <dl>
            <dt>Gabriel Farhenheit Scale (°F)</dt>
            <dd>Between boiling and freezing
               points of water at regular ground level pressure is divided into
               180 units. Water here freezes at 32°F and boils at 212°F.
            </dd>

            <dt>Anders Celsius Scale (°F)</dt>
            <dd>Between boiling and freezing
               points of water at regular ground level pressure is divided into
               100 units. Water here freezes at 0°C and boils at 100°C.
            </dd>

            <dt>Lord Kelvin Scale (K)</dt>
            <dd>Usually used for scientific purposes,
               and is 0°C is 273 K. Numbers may not be negative.
            </dd>
         </dl>

         <p>Conversions are as follows:</p>
         <p>°F = (1.8)(°C) + 32</p>
         <p>K = °C + 273</p>

         </article>

         <article>
            <h2>Phase Changes and Consequences</h2>
            <p>There are phase changes, such as liquid
               water turning into vapor or vapor turning
               into liquid, or even directly turning into solid.
               Let us say water is the system. In an endothermic
               phase change, water needs energy, or heat, which
               sometimes is called latent heat in certain situations,
               to change into a higher temperature phase.
               In an exothermic phase change, Energy is
               released from that water when the water can translated
               into a colder temperature phase.
            </p>
            <p>Below are examples.</p>

            <ul>
               <li>Evaporation - liquid to gas - endothermic</li>
               <li>Sublimation - solid to gas - endothermic</li>
               <li>Melting - solid to liquid - endothermic</li>
               <li>Condensation - gas to liquid - exothermic</li>
               <li>Freezing - liquid to solid - exothermic</li>
               <li>Deposition - gas to solid - exothermic</li>
            </ul>

            <p>The sun's energy evaporates water from the surface
               of the Earth. But when this vapor travels upward, it
               becomes too cold and the water molecules lose their speed
               and begin to become attracted to each other more significantly.
               Then condensation of water - lots of molecules - occurs.
               And from the above list, we see condensation is an exothermic
               reaction, so heat is released. This is of vital significance
               for energy to be translated into the effects of storms.
            </p>

            <h2>Three Forms of Energy Transfer</h2>

            <p>Energy can be trasnferred in a variety of ways.
               We will go over three ways.
            </p>


            <dl>
               <dt>Conduction</dt>
               <dd>A molecule's energy and vibrations comes into
                  contact with another. That molecule then absorbs
                  some of that energy. Note that different molecules
                  and aggregates of molecules have different abilities
                  to do this, we can measure this by heat conductivities.
                  Water is a poor conductor and air even poorer.

            </dl>
            <dl>
               <dt>Radiation</dt>
               <dd>Radiation is a significant topic and is
                  discussed in the next section.

            <h2>Radiation</h2>
            <p>Radiation consists of things called <em>photons</em>, which 
            are quantized packets of energy. Packets of photons make up waves,
            and these waves are a form of radiation.</p>

            <p><strong>All things emit radiation.</strong></p>

            <p>Now the wavelengths of this radiation depend primarily on 
               temperature.
            </p>

            <p>Many of the objects you see are do not radiate in the wavelengths of human
               vision. So how we can see them? Because other sources of light, especially
               the Sun, provide waves to reflect and bounce off everywhere. (If there where
               none of this, everything would be dark).
            </p>

            <p>
               The maximum rate of radiation by a square meter of an object is given in 
               Watts per meter squared. This can be calculated through an equation using
               the Josef Stefan-Ludwig Boltzmann Constant: σ, which is 5.67 x 10<sup>-8</sup> W/m<sup>2</sup>K<sup>4</sup>.

            </p>

            <p><strong>E<sub>A</sub> = σT<sup>4</sup></strong></p>

            <p>Wilhelm Wein has another law:</p>

            <p><strong>λ<sub>max</sub> = ( 2900 μm x K ) / T</strong></p>

            <p>λ<sub>max</sub> is the wavelength of maximum emission, T is Temperature.</p>

               <figcaption>Radiation Diagram of Sun</figcaption>
            </figure> 

            <p>Objects absorb and emit radiation. An object that is a perfect absorber
               (it will absorb ALL the radiation that hits it)
               <em>and</em> a perfect emitter (it will do a perfect job on emitting
               the maximum radiation at a certain temperature) is called a <em>blackbody.</em>
            </p>

            <p>A blackbody is theoretical, but things extremely close with little offset
               that match this definition are the Sun and the Earth.
            </p>

            <p>Wein's Law and Stefan Boltzmann's Law usually apply to blackbodies.
            </p>

            <p>Radiative Equilibirum -  absorption of radiation equals the rate of emission.</p>
            <p>There is a radiative equilibrium on Earth, it absorbs from Sun and emits out.
               The average temperature at which this occurs is called the radiative equi. temperature.</p>
            </p>

            <p>Earth's equilibirum temperature is -18°C. But we must make a significant addend
               to this. This is the Earth's atmosphere. Without the atmosphere, we would
               feel much colder.
            </p>

         <article>
            <h2>My Greenhouse Gases, My Saviours and My Enemies</h2>

            <p>Kirchoff's Law of Radiation - for gases, good absorbers are good
               emitters at a particular wavelength, and poor absorbers are poor 
               emitters at a wavelength.
            </p>

            <p>
               Some gases in the atmosphere, called greenhouse gases,
               area able to capture the emitting radiation that was supposed
               to go to space, then emitting it back to the Earth. While all this
               is happening dynamically, on average, not all the Earth's emission
               escapes. This phenomenon is known as the atmopsheric greenhouse effects
               (note: the effect of warming in a greenhouse is caused for different
               reasons).

               
            </p>

            <p>(There is a special exception, from 8 to 11 micrometers roughly,
               water vapor and carbon dioxide for some reason do not absorb this 
               wavelength and so that Earth radiation is able to escape into space.
               This range is known as the atmospheric window).
            </p>

            <p>Certain clouds can enhance the atm. greenhouse effect - the
               liquid cloud droplets in them also capture emitting radiation and 
               emit it back. They even can capture the radiation in the range
               of the atmopsheric window. But some clouds (low thick) can also be significant
               emitters which radiate back to space. 
            </p>

            <p>
               In the last century, the average surface air temperature rose a degree
               Celsius. Carbon dioxide has been increasingly released into the atmosphere,
               leading to some warming and higher rates of evaporation of water. With 
               more and more water molecules entering the gas phase rather than retaining
               their liquid life, they are able to increase IR radiation back to Earth.
            </p>

            <p>Clouds and oceans are being studied, they could be a factor.</p>
